To build the exe version:

1. I had to copy the sqlite3.dll into the Plugins folder from the x86 subfolder of SQLite4Unity3d.
The zip file is in this folder.

2. I had to copy Database folder into the WoB_client_win_Data folder!

3. The converge-ecosystems file must copied to the same directory level as the exe file.
